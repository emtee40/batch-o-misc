	Abstract = {This paper presents ModelNet, a scalable Internet
                 emulation environment that enables researchers to deploy
                 unmodified software prototypes in a configurable
                 Internet-like environment and subject them to faults and
                 varying network conditions. Edge nodes running
                 user-specified OS (operating system) and application
                 software are configured to route their packets through a
                 set of ModelNet core nodes, which cooperate to subject
                 the traffic to the bandwidth, congestion constraints,
                 latency, and loss profile of a target network topology.
                 This paper describes and evaluates the ModelNet
                 architecture and its implementation, including novel
                 techniques to balance emulation accuracy against
                 scalability. The current ModelNet prototype is able to
                 accurately subject thousands of instances of a
                 distributed application to Internet-like conditions with
                 gigabits of bisection bandwidth. Experiments with several
                 large-scale distributed services demonstrate the
                 generality and effectiveness of the infrastructure},
